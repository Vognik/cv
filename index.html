						<p>Hi there!<br>My name is Alex Pavlenko and welcome to my demo page.<br> It was created to share some of my pet-projects and also to tell about other projects that I was engaged in. All code which you would find here is open-source. So feel free to copy, change and modify it accordingly to your needs.<br> Well, there aren't too many things to do, but you can try to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Check out some JS apps like: interactive aquarium or test of your knowledge of math.</li>
							<li>Become acquainted with my PHP projects: static maps generator and number to text converter.</li>
							<li>View and download my resume, if you're interested in passionate Junior Web Developer.</li>
							<li>Look at my code, my code is amazing.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>And that's it! Thank you for reading so far. Have fun!</p>
